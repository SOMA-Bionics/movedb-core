# Conda Packaging Setup Summary

## ✅ Complete Setup

Your movedb-core project is now fully configured for automatic conda package distribution via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## 🏗️ What's Configured

### 1. Conda Recipe Files
- `conda-recipe/meta.yaml` - Package metadata, dependencies, build configuration
- `conda-recipe/conda_build_config.yaml` - Build matrix (Python 3.8-3.12)

### 2. CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
- **Release Job**: Uploads to main channel on tagged releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Upload Job**: Uploads to dev channel on main branch pushes
- Includes comprehensive testing, linting, and building

### 3. Build Scripts
- `scripts/build_conda.sh` - Local conda package building
- `scripts/validate_package.sh` - Package validation
- `scripts/setup_anaconda_integration.sh` - Setup helper for GitHub secrets

### 4. Makefile Commands
- `make build` - Build conda package
- `make upload-conda` - Upload to Anaconda.org
- `make build-upload` - Build and upload in one command
- `make clean-conda` - Clean build artifacts

### 5. Documentation
- `docs/CONDA_PACKAGING.md` - Comprehensive conda packaging guide
- Updated `README.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` with conda info

## 🔧 Setup Required

To enable automatic uploads, you need to configure GitHub secrets:

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup_anaconda_integration.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create an Anaconda.org account
2. Generate an API token with upload permissions
3. Add GitHub secrets:
   - `ANACONDA_USER`: Your Anaconda.org username
   - `ANACONDA_API_TOKEN`: Your API token

## 📦 How It Works

### Tagged Releases
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
→ Automatically uploads to main channel

### Main Branch Development
```bash
git push origin main
```
→ Automatically uploads to dev channel

## 🚀 Usage

### For End Users
```bash
# Stable releases
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME movedb-core

# Development versions
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME -c dev movedb-core
```

### For Developers
```bash
# Local building
make build

# Local build and upload
make build-upload

# Clean builds
make clean-conda
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor builds in the Actions tab
- **Anaconda.org**: Track uploads at `https://anaconda.org/YOUR_USERNAME/movedb-core`
- **CI Status**: Status badges in README.md

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Configure secrets**: Run `./setup_anaconda_integration.sh`
2. **Test the workflow**: Create a test tag or push to main
3. **Monitor builds**: Check GitHub Actions and Anaconda.org
4. **Update documentation**: Add your Anaconda.org username to installation instructions

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Automated distribution**: No manual uploads needed
- **Quality assurance**: Only uploads after all tests pass
- **Version management**: Separate stable and development channels
- **Dependency management**: Conda handles complex dependencies (ezc3d, opensim)
- **Multi-platform**: Builds for different Python versions and platforms

Your conda packaging setup is complete and ready to use! 🎉
