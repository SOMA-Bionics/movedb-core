- [ ] **API Reference**: Auto-generated API documentation
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: If any breaking changes from 0.x

### ðŸ§ª Testing

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Real-world data testing
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking critical operations

- [ ] **GitHub Releases**: Proper release notes and changelogs
- [ ] **Version Management**: Automated version bumping working smoothly

## Suggested Timeline

### Phase 1: API Stabilization (2-4 weeks)

- Review and finalize public API
- Add comprehensive type hints
- Improve error handling and validation
- Write missing docstrings

### Phase 2: Testing & Quality (2-3 weeks)

- Increase test coverage to >90%
- Add integration tests with real data
- Performance testing and optimization
- Fix any remaining linting issues

### Phase 3: Documentation (2-3 weeks)

- Complete user guide and tutorials
- Auto-generate API documentation
- Review and polish all documentation
- Create examples and cookbook

### Phase 4: Pre-release Testing (1-2 weeks)

- Release v1.0.0rc1 for community testing
- Gather feedback and fix issues
- Final polish and preparation

### Phase 5: Release (1 week)

- Official v1.0.0 release
- Conda-forge submission
- Community announcement

**Total Timeline: ~8-12 weeks**

## Version Numbering Strategy

### Pre-1.0.0 Releases

- `v0.2.0` - API stabilization and major improvements
- `v0.3.0` - Testing and documentation improvements
- `v0.9.0` - Feature-complete beta
- `v1.0.0rc1` - Release candidate
- `v1.0.0` - Stable release

### Post-1.0.0 Strategy

- **Patch** (1.0.x): Bug fixes, documentation updates
- **Minor** (1.x.0): New features, non-breaking changes
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking API changes (avoid if possible)

## Breaking Changes to Consider

If any breaking changes are needed, do them before 1.0.0:

### Potential Areas for Review

- [ ] **Import Structure**: Is the current import structure optimal?
- [ ] **Method Names**: Are all method names intuitive and consistent?
- [ ] **Parameter Names**: Consistent parameter naming across API
- [ ] **Return Types**: Consistent return types and error handling
- [ ] **Configuration**: How users configure the library

### API Stability Promise

After 1.0.0, we commit to:

- Semantic versioning
- Deprecation warnings before breaking changes
- Migration guides for major versions
- Backward compatibility within major versions

## Quality Gates for 1.0.0

Each item must be complete before release:

### Code Quality

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] >90% test coverage
- [ ] No critical linting errors
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets

### Documentation

- [ ] All public APIs documented
- [ ] User guide complete
- [ ] Installation instructions tested
- [ ] Examples work and are tested

### Distribution

- [ ] PyPI package builds and installs correctly
- [ ] Conda package builds and installs correctly
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline fully functional
- [ ] GitHub releases automated

### Community

- [ ] Contributing guidelines clear
- [ ] Issue templates created
- [ ] License and copyright clear
- [ ] Code of conduct in place

## Tools and Automation

### Quality Assurance

```bash
# Pre-release checklist
make ci-check          # Run full CI checks locally
make test-coverage     # Ensure coverage targets met
make docs             # Build and check documentation
make build-all        # Test both conda and PyPI builds
```

### Version Management

```bash
# When ready for each milestone
make bump-minor       # 0.1.3 -> 0.2.0
make bump-version VERSION=0.9.0  # Beta release
make bump-version VERSION=1.0.0rc1  # Release candidate
make release-major    # Final 1.0.0 release
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Test coverage >90%
- Build time <5 minutes
- Package size <50MB
- Import time <2 seconds
- Memory usage efficient

### Community Metrics

- Documentation completeness
- User feedback positive
- Issue resolution time
- Contributor engagement

## Next Steps

1. **Choose first milestone**: Decide on v0.2.0 goals
2. **Create issues**: Break down work into GitHub issues
3. **Set timeline**: Choose realistic deadlines
4. **Start development**: Begin with highest-priority items
