# pytest Setup Summary

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

### 1. **Comprehensive Environment Configuration**
- `environment.yml` includes all testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, black, etc.)
- `pyproject.toml` has comprehensive pytest configuration with:
  - Coverage settings
  - Test markers for organization
  - Warning filters for cleaner output
  - Sensible defaults for test discovery

### 2. **Easy-to-Use Developer Tools**

#### **Makefile Commands** (recommended approach)
```bash
make test-quick        # Fast tests without coverage
make test             # Full test suite with coverage
make test-specific FILE=test_basic.py  # Run specific test file
make test-pattern PATTERN=imports      # Run tests matching pattern
make format           # Format code with black
make lint             # Run linting
make clean            # Clean build artifacts
make help             # Show all commands
```

#### **Python Test Runner** (`run_tests.py`)
```bash
python run_tests.py            # Run all tests with coverage
python run_tests.py --help     # Show help
python run_tests.py -v         # Verbose output
python run_tests.py -k imports # Pattern matching
```

#### **Direct pytest Usage**
```bash
pytest                         # Run all tests
pytest --no-cov               # Skip coverage
pytest tests/test_basic.py -v  # Specific file
pytest -k "imports" -v         # Pattern matching
```

### 3. **Documentation**
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `docs/API_DESIGN.md` - API design documentation
- Updated README.md with testing section

### 4. **IDE Integration**
- VSCode settings documented in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` works with most IDEs

## ðŸš€ Quick Developer Onboarding

New developers can get started with just:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SOMA-Bionics/movedb-core.git
cd movedb-core
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate movedb-core-dev
pip install -e .
make test-quick
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Organization

Tests are structured using explicit submodule imports:
```python
# Recommended style
from movedb.core import Trial, Event
from movedb.file_io import C3DLoader

# Tests support this future-ready API structure
```

## ðŸ“Š Coverage and Quality

- HTML coverage reports generated in `htmlcov/`
- Code formatting with black
- Linting with flake8
- Type checking with mypy
- All configured and ready to use

## ðŸ”§ What This Solves

1. **No more manual pytest setup** - Everything is pre-configured
2. **Consistent testing across developers** - Same environment for everyone
3. **Easy test discovery** - Clear commands for different test scenarios
4. **IDE integration** - Works with VSCode, PyCharm, etc.
5. **CI/CD ready** - All tools configured for automation

Developers can now focus on writing tests and code instead of configuring tools!
