# Conda Packaging and Distribution

This document describes the conda packaging and automated distribution setup for movedb-core.

## ‚úÖ Overview

The project uses conda for packaging and distribution, with automatic uploads to Anaconda.org through GitHub Actions CI/CD. This ensures reliable distribution of the package with all its dependencies, including `ezc3d` and `opensim` which are not available on PyPI.

### üèóÔ∏è What's Configured

1. **Conda Recipe Files**: `conda-recipe/meta.yaml` and build configuration
2. **CI/CD Workflow**: Automatic uploads to main and dev channels
3. **Build Scripts**: Local building and validation tools
4. **Makefile Commands**: Easy development commands
5. **Complete Documentation**: Setup and usage guides

## Package Structure

### Conda Recipe

The conda package is defined in `conda-recipe/meta.yaml`:

- **Package metadata**: Name, version, description, license
- **Dependencies**: Runtime and build dependencies
- **Build configuration**: Entry points, test commands
- **About section**: Documentation links, license info

### Build Configuration

`conda-recipe/conda_build_config.yaml` defines:
- Supported Python versions (3.8-3.12)
- Build matrix configuration
- Channel priorities

## Automated Distribution

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD workflow (`/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) includes two distribution jobs:

#### 1. Release Job (Tagged Releases)
- **Trigger**: Git tags matching `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Action**: Uploads to main channel on Anaconda.org
- **Installation**: `conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME movedb-core`

#### 2. Upload Job (Main Branch)
- **Trigger**: Pushes to `main` branch
- **Action**: Uploads to `dev` channel on Anaconda.org
- **Installation**: `conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME -c dev movedb-core`

### Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

1. **ANACONDA_USER**: Your Anaconda.org username
2. **ANACONDA_API_TOKEN**: API token with upload permissions

#### Creating an API Token
1. Go to [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org)
2. Log in and go to Settings ‚Üí Access ‚Üí API tokens
3. Create a new token with upload permissions
4. Add the token as `ANACONDA_API_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

### Setup Helper

Use the automated setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup_anaconda_integration.sh
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### Automatic Distribution

#### Tagged Releases ‚Üí Main Channel
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
‚Üí Automatically uploads to main channel (ready for conda-forge submission!)

#### Main Branch ‚Üí Dev Channel
```bash
git push origin main
```
‚Üí Automatically uploads to dev channel for testing

### Usage

#### For End Users
```bash
# Stable releases (recommended)
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME movedb-core

# Development versions (testing)
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME -c dev movedb-core
```

1. Go to [Anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to: Account Settings ‚Üí Access ‚Üí API tokens
4. Create a new token with upload permissions
5. Copy the token (shown only once)

## Manual Building and Upload

### Local Build

```bash
# Install build dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge conda-build conda-verify

# Build package
./scripts/build_conda.sh

# Verify build
conda-verify dist/conda/**/*.conda
```

### Manual Upload

```bash
# Install anaconda-client
conda install -c conda-forge anaconda-client

# Login to anaconda.org
anaconda login

# Upload package
anaconda upload dist/conda/**/*.conda

# Upload to specific channel
anaconda upload --label dev dist/conda/**/*.conda
```

## Installation Methods

### For End Users

```bash
# Stable release
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME movedb-core

# Development version
conda install -c YOUR_USERNAME -c dev movedb-core
```

### For Developers

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/movedb-core.git
cd movedb-core

# Create development environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate movedb-core-dev

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Local development commands
make build               # Build conda package locally
make build-upload        # Build and upload to main channel
make build-upload-dev    # Build and upload to dev channel
make upload-conda        # Upload existing package to main channel
make clean-conda         # Clean build artifacts
```

## üîß Available Commands

The Makefile provides several commands for building and uploading conda packages:

**Build Commands:**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make build` | Build conda package locally |
| `./scripts/build_conda.sh` | Direct build script |
| `./scripts/validate_package.sh` | Package validation |

**Upload Commands:**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make upload-conda` | Upload existing package to main channel |
| `make upload-conda-dev` | Upload existing package to dev channel |

**Combined Commands (Build + Upload):**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make build-upload` | Build and upload to main channel (combines build + upload) |
| `make build-upload-dev` | Build and upload to dev channel (combines build + upload) |

**Utility Commands:**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make clean-conda` | Clean build artifacts |

### Usage Notes

- **For most workflows**: Use `make build-upload` or `make build-upload-dev` to build and upload in one step
- **For testing builds**: Use `make build` followed by `make validate` to test locally before uploading
- **For re-uploading**: Use `make upload-conda` or `make upload-conda-dev` if you already have a built package

## Package Channels

- **Main channel**: Stable releases from tagged versions
- **Dev channel**: Development builds from main branch
- **Testing**: Local builds and testing

## Build Process

1. **Source preparation**: Code is packaged from the repository
2. **Dependency resolution**: Conda resolves all dependencies
3. **Build execution**: Package is built in isolated environment
4. **Testing**: Built package is tested with specified test commands
5. **Upload**: Package is uploaded to Anaconda.org

## Best Practices

### Version Management

- Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Tag releases properly for stable channel upload
- Development versions get automatic version suffixes

### Dependencies

- Specify exact dependency versions for reproducibility
- Use conda-forge channel for most dependencies
- Document any special dependency requirements

### Testing

- All packages are tested before upload
- CI/CD ensures quality before distribution
- Local testing available with `conda-verify`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build failures**: Check dependency versions in `meta.yaml`
2. **Upload failures**: Verify API token permissions
3. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all deps are available in specified channels

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check build log
conda build conda-recipe/ --debug

# List package contents
conda search --info movedb-core

# Check dependencies
conda inspect linkages movedb-core
```

## üîç Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor builds in the Actions tab
- **Anaconda.org**: Track uploads at `https://anaconda.org/YOUR_USERNAME/movedb-core`
- **CI Status**: Status badges in README.md
- **Download Statistics**: Available on Anaconda.org package page

## üéØ Benefits

- **Automated distribution**: No manual uploads needed
- **Quality assurance**: Only uploads after all tests pass
- **Version management**: Separate stable and development channels
- **Dependency management**: Conda handles complex dependencies (ezc3d, opensim)
- **Multi-platform**: Builds for different Python versions and platforms

## Security

- API tokens are stored as GitHub secrets
- Never commit tokens to repository
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Use least-privilege access for tokens
