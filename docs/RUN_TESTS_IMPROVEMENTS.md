# run_tests.py Improvements Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### **Removed Hard-coded Environment Name**
- **Before**: Script required `'movedb-core-dev'` environment specifically
- **After**: Works with any conda environment that has the required dependencies

### **Flexible Environment Checking**
- **Before**: Failed if not in the exact expected environment
- **After**: Warns about environment issues but continues if package is properly installed

### **Better Error Handling**
- **Before**: Would exit immediately if environment name didn't match
- **After**: Checks for actual dependencies (like pytest) and package installation

### **Removed Conflicting Configuration**
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate `pytest.ini` file that conflicted with `pyproject.toml`
- **Result**: Clean, single-source pytest configuration

## üöÄ **How It Works Now**

### **Environment Detection**
```python
def check_environment():
    """Check if we're in a conda environment with required dependencies."""
    conda_env = os.environ.get('CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV')
    if not conda_env:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: No conda environment detected")
        return True  # Don't fail, just warn
    
    # Check if pytest is available
    try:
        import pytest
        print(f"‚úÖ Running in conda environment: {conda_env}")
        return True
    except ImportError:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: pytest not available in environment '{conda_env}'")
        return False
```

### **Flexible Usage**
```bash
# Works in any environment with proper dependencies
conda activate my-custom-env
python run_tests.py

# Works in the recommended environment
conda activate movedb-core-dev
python run_tests.py

# Works even without conda (with warnings)
python run_tests.py
```

## üîß **Benefits**

### **1. Environment Flexibility**
- Developers can use their own environment names
- Works in CI/CD environments with different naming
- Supports multiple development setups

### **2. Better Developer Experience**
- Clear warnings instead of hard failures
- Helpful error messages
- Continues when possible

### **3. CI/CD Compatibility**
- Works with GitHub Actions environments
- Compatible with different CI naming schemes
- Robust error handling

### **4. Dependency Validation**
- Actually checks for pytest availability
- Validates package installation
- Provides actionable error messages

## üìù **Updated Documentation**

### **Development Guide Updates**
- Added multiple environment setup options
- Clarified that any properly configured environment works
- Updated troubleshooting section

### **Flexibility Examples**
```bash
# Option 1: Use provided environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate movedb-core-dev

# Option 2: Create custom environment
conda create -n my-env python=3.11
conda activate my-env
conda install -c conda-forge -c opensim-org pytest pytest-cov ...

# Option 3: Use existing environment
conda activate existing-env
conda install pytest pytest-cov  # add missing dependencies
```

## üéØ **Key Changes Made**

1. **Removed hard-coded environment name check**
2. **Added pytest availability check**
3. **Improved error messages and warnings**
4. **Made environment checking non-blocking**
5. **Removed conflicting pytest.ini file**
6. **Updated documentation for flexibility**

## ‚úÖ **Result**

The `run_tests.py` script is now much more flexible and user-friendly:
- Works with any properly configured conda environment
- Provides helpful warnings instead of hard failures
- Maintains compatibility with existing workflows
- Better suited for diverse development and CI environments

This makes the tool more accessible to developers who may have different environment naming conventions or CI/CD setups!
